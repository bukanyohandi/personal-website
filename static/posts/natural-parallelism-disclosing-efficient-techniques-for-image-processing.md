Natural parallelism often presents itself in computational problems where individual tasks do not rely on others. This inherent parallel nature is frequently seen in the domain of image processing, where actions on pixels are mostly independent. This project delves into this nature by utilizing multiple parallel programming paradigms to efficiently process images.
