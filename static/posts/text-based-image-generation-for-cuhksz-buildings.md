In the current visually-driven world, combining text and imagery offers a unique way to explore and document various subjects. Our project focuses on this intersection, specifically on the architectural landscape of CUHK-Shenzhen. We chose this topic for several reasons. Firstly, it provides a familiarization for new and exchange students with campus architecture before their arrival. Secondly, it contributes to the architectural and cultural documentation of CUHK-Shenzhen, preserving its unique identity for posterity. Lastly, our work aligns with the aspiration to contribute to the academic community at CUHK-Shenzhen, particularly in shaping future research and developments in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
