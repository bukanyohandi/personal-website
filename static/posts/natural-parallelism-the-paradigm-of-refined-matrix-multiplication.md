In contemporary artificial intelligence, matrix multiplication is omnipresent, making it a foundational component of intricate computations. With the advent of architectures, optimizing matrix multiplication is more relevant than ever. The scope of this project will be solely focus on the most generalized form: dense matrix multiplication.
