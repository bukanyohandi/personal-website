Sorting algorithms are of great importance in computer science. Traditionally taught in data structure and algorithm courses, these algorithms have been foundational in organizing and managing data. However, the advent of multi-core processors and distributed computing brings a new dimension to these algorithms: the possibility of running them in parallel on multi-core CPUs or even distributing them across a computing cluster. This transition from a sequential to a parallel and distributed environment poses unique challenges. It is not just about sorting data efficiently but also about how to divide the entire task into different threads or processes. Moreover, in a distributed and parallel setting, the work of different threads or processes is no longer independent. This necessitates a sophisticated approach where these units must communicate with each other to synchronize their states and ensure the correctness of the algorithms.
