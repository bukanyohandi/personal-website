With the extension concepts of parallel computing, natural parallelism can be further blended into the realm of machine learning. This project specifically focuses on accelerating softmax regression, neural networks, and convolutional neural networks using OpenACC. OpenACC offers a simplified approach to programming for parallel computing, particularly for GPU acceleration.
