a normal browser results in an error. This
error mainly happens due to a policy that
does not allow a particular file to access

1) Download the "Live Server" extension in
   Visual Studio Code by Ritwick Dey
2) Open a directory of this folder in
   Explorer
3) Press "Go Live" button on the bottom
   right side of the screen
4) A browser will pop up and it will
   launch a local server development
