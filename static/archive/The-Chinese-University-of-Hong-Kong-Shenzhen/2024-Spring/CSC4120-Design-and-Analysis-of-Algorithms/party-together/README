# CSC4120 Project - Party Together Problem 

This is a minimal implementation of an interactive command line client to run our project. Essentially, you only need to write the solvers as we've settled down everything else for you. 

## Requirements
`pip install networkx`

## Run the client
Type in the terminal

`python main.py`

Following instructions are supported:

- exit: quit the client
- ls_input: list all input files (default under ./inputs folder)
- ck_input: check whether student created inputs are valid or not
- test_pthp: test pthp solver 
- test_ptp: test ptp solver
- test_pthp_all: test pthp solver on all input files
- test_ptp_all: test ptp solver on all input files
- --help: get help instructions
